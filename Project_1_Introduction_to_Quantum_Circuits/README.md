# Project 1: Introduction to Quantum Circuits

## Objective

To understand basic quantum gates and quantum circuits.

## Description

In this project, you will:
- Install Qiskit and set up the environment.
- Create a basic quantum circuit with a single qubit.
- Apply basic quantum gates (X, H, Z) and measure the qubit.
- Visualize the circuit and the measurement results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that the necessary packages have been installed as outlined in the main repository README.
