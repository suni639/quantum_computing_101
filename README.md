# Quantum Computing with Python and Qiskit

This repo contains a series of projects designed to introduce and deepen my understanding of quantum computing using Python and Qiskit. Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and covering a wide range of fundamental concepts and advanced topics.

Each project directory will have its own `README.md` with detailed instructions and explanations specific to that project/topic.

## Project Overview

1. [**Introduction to Quantum Circuits**](./Project_1_Introduction_to_Quantum_Circuits/README.md)
2. [**Superposition and Entanglement**](./Project_2_Superposition_and_Entanglement/README.md)
3. [**Quantum Algorithms - Grover's Algorithm**](./Project_3_Grovers_Algorithm/README.md)
4. [**Quantum Teleportation**](./Project_4_Quantum_Teleportation/README.md)
5. [**Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**](./Project_5_Variational_Quantum_Eigensolver/README.md)
6. [**Quantum Machine Learning**](./Project_6_Quantum_Machine_Learning/README.md)
7. [**Quantum Error Correction**](./Project_7_Quantum_Error_Correction/README.md)
8. [**Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms**](./Project_8_Hybrid_Quantum_Classical_Algorithms/README.md)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
